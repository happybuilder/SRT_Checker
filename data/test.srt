1
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,818
若你要拿來外敷
For external application of urine,

2
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:10,496
甚麼時候都可以
any time will do. 

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,056
例如你臨睡前
E.g., before sleep.

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,896
當然你不要大汗淋漓的時候去敷
But don't apply it when you're sweating profusely.

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,200
你總要把外敷處先洗乾淨And you gotta clean the part for application 1st. 

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
洗乾淨你的面龐
Wash your cheeks clean

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:26,880
然後你才敷啦 如果你頭很髒
before application. If your hair's dirty,

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,464
那麼你洗完頭才敷啦
Wash it before application. 

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,256
這是最基本的了
This is the basics. 

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,096
你敷完之後 然後你就去看那個酸鹼度
After application, check the alkalinity. 

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,424
然後你就再慢慢去…
Then gradually...

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
還有好多好多提議的 我的提議就是
There're many other suggestions. My suggestions

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
這是我親自做的方法
are based on my own practice. 

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,528
我覺得我洗完腸之後
I've found that after colonic irrigation,

15
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:51,200
那個天水和它的酸鹼度是最好的  
the alkalinity of the heavenly fluid is the best. 

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
那個天水的味道 各方面的狀態最好
The taste and other aspects of the urine are optimal.

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
如果你說我那個時候
When my health was very poor,

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
身體很差的時候呢
as mentioned by you,

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
我也是混入蒸餾水去飲
I mixed it with distilled water 

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
混了蒸餾水飲 (讓他淡一點)And diluted it. 

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,936
雖然酸鹼度低了 但它的色素還是很差
Tho' the acidity's lowered, the color's still bad.

22
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,288
氣味還是很大
The odor's still strong. 

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,360
所以我就知道 不是因為我食了肉
So I knew tis not 'cause I'd eaten meat,

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
而是我身體入面的器官
but 'cause my internal organs

25
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,480
或者有些東西
or something else

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
開始腐爛
began to rot. 

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
即是所謂我們的內傷
That's what we call internal injury.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,696
那你飲天水 就可以幫你
Then Heavenly Fluid can help you

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
回復起身體的器官的一些內傷
heal your organ's internal injury. 

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,607
那你可不可以告訴大家
Then could you tell us

31
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:43,680
你大概飲了多久 便真的有一個好明顯的
how long after drinking it

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,984
身體是出現一個好轉
did your health show an obvious improvement?

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,800
其實最明顯、最快的就是
Indeed, the most obvious and fastest way

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
搽頭髮
is to apply heavenly fluid

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
用天水搽頭髮
to your hair.

36
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
可能兩個禮拜已經看到
It may take just two weeks

37
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
白髮變黑髮
to find your hair turning from white to black

38
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
又濃密了And growing thicker. 

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,600
白髮變黑 不是全部
Not all your hair turning black. 

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:10,560
你可能會發現某一撮頭髮會早一點變黑
But you'll find a pinch of it blackening 1st. 

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
而且你掉頭髮是減少了And your hair loss

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
掉頭髮少了的
will be reduced. 

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,240
另外呢 就是搽皮膚
Next is application to the skin. 

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
其實皮膚呢
When you apply heavenly fluid to the skin,

45
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,200
你搽皮膚 皮膚也能吸收天水
it can be absorbed by the skin.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,296
因為它本身會吸收水份
As the skin itself can absorb moisture,

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136
所以天水也會從你的皮膚入血
urine can enter your blood via your skin.

48
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
甚至乎我研究到有些做法
I've even found another way:-

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
是直接用針把天水打入皮膚
i.e. to directly inject heavenly fluid 

50
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,536
即是用注射式
into the skin with a needle. 

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,719
是的 Osiris 也有用 因為好多年前
Yes, Western medicine also uses it. Years ago,

52
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,448
我看過一個影片 就是講有一個心臟藥
I saw a video about a heart disease drug

53
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,056
是特效心臟藥來的 他們是用呢個尿酶素
which uses urea. 

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,933
他就賣到很貴 即使去到大陸
Its price's very high; 

55
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:59,200
那些藥廠製藥 講的差唔多…  （（恕難明白））
Even when tis manufactured in China,

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
十幾年前說的都好像是接近一萬元美金 是啊
it cost almost US$10K 10 odd yrs. ago!

57
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,829
那麼那些尿酶素是如何做呢
How's the urea produced? 

58
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:11,744
他們是收集了大量的尿液
A lot of urine was collected.

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,681
然後不知多少桶呢
It took numerous barrels of urine

60
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:20,960
才做到一粒尿酶素藥丸
to prepare 1 urea pill. 

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:30,944
那其實是對某種心臟病的特效藥劑 是呀
Tis a wonder drug for heart disease. Yes!

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
聽眾都可能會有好多疑問
Many watchers may have many queries.

63
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
就是會覺得
They may be concerned:

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,125
就算我想試用天水
I may wanna try heavenly fluid, 

65
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,184
又或者我衝破了心理障礙啦
or I've overcome the psychological barrier. 

66
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
很多人還是會關心「啊! 我本身身體都有病喎!」
But still many people're worried, "But I'm ill!"   

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
因為通常也是因為現在身體有事
For usu. you won't be willing to try it

68
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,680
你才會勇於去嘗試這個方式啦
unless you got a health problem. 

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,894
那他們還應不應飲用天水呢
They wonder if they should drink urine while sick,

70
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:59,616
又或者飲用天水 有沒有一些避忌
Or are there any don'ts about urine drinking? 

71
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,678
可能是有甚麼病不能飲呢
Or is it bad for certain diseases? 

72
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,301
或者有沒有甚麼特別的徵狀 飲天水會特別好
Or is it esp. good for certain symptoms? 

73
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,247
即如嘉賓 Victor 那樣
Just like our guest Victor. 

74
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:12,039
他當時就是去到身體應該是糖尿二期
He was then at Diabetes Stage II

75
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,488
又有爛腳的樣子啦
with Athlete's Foot. 

76
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
你那個時候
At that time,

77
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
是如何用天水
how did you use heavenly fluid?

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,359
或者你開頭你都在說
As put by yourself,

79
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,471
你的天水的質素都不是那麼好呀
your urine's quality then was no good. 

80
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,335
是如何慢慢從飲用天水
How did you gradually drink urine

81
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
改善到個身體之後
till your health improved

82
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,100
就令到自己之後的天水And your heavenly fluid

83
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,039
也越來越好
kept improving, too?

84
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,626
剛巧我看到 其實很多關於「三焦」的情況
I've read a lot about the "three burners",

85
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,975
就有一個叫「焦消症」的
including "burner diabetes"

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,042
他們也是用天水作治理
which can be cured by uropathy.

87
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:55,167
可否簡短的說一下 甚麼叫做「三焦」
Pls briefly explain what's "three burners" 

88
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,495
可能中醫常說的「三焦」 
What's "three burners"

89
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,799
甚麼謂之「三焦」呢
in Chinese herbal medicine? 

90
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
「中焦」就是你的肝、膽、胰臟
The "middle burner" comprises your liver, gall bladder, spleen.

91
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:09,503
那個部位開始腐爛
The part which begins to rot,

92
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,367
即是開始發炎 開始去到變壞那個程度
i.e. to become inflamed, is usu. in the middle burner,

93
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,743
通常是在中焦的 因為現代人大多是富貴病嘛   
as most modern people got Rich Man's Disease. 

94
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
那麼然後呢
And then?

95
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,095
就去到「下焦」呢
Then comes the "lower burner"

96
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
腳趾距離你的心臟是最遠的
Toes're farthest away from your heart. 

97
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,487
那麼「下焦」那個情況呢
What about the "lower burner"?

98
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,311
就是說你的腳趾離開你的身體最遠
As your toes're farthest away from your trunk,

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
所以所有的血氣
in terms of sap, 

100
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
它是最弱的
they're the weakest. 

101
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,325
如是者在你腳趾腐爛的那個情況呢
When your toes rot, 

102
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:44,575
它的復原呢
how do they recover? 

103
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
有些情況是
In some situations, 

104
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
你剪腳甲
when you trim 1 of your toes' nails, 

105
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
然後就流血不止
it may bleed without end.

106
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
然後你去看西醫
When you consult a Western-style doctor,

107
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
他就叫你截掉它！
he'll ask you to amputate it! 

108
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,959
所以在這個情況 我就看到好多
I've seen many such cases. 

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,311
更加會令到我願意嘗試這個天水啦
Makes me wanna try uropathy ever more. 

110
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,895
而亦都相對來說 我飲了天水之後
After drinking heavenly fluid 

111
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,479
應該兩個禮拜左右 我已經感覺到個傷口
for about 2 wks, I already felt my wound

112
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,807
已經在入面已經有好轉呀 不是從外面啊
healing from within rather than without. 

113
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,810
即是你身體機能開始慢慢回復過來
So your body began to gradually recover.

114
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,418
你看到傷口內裏已經有變化
The wound's visibly changing inside.

115
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:25,497
然後我再拿些天水灑上去
Then I sprayed some urine onto my wound

116
00:06:25,497 --> 00:06:29,119
或者說我有時拿來…浸浸它 And sometimes soaked my wound in urine. 

117
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
拿個水盤放水 將天水加熱
I'd warm up urine in a basin with water

118
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
浸泡一下傷口呢And soak my wound in it.

119
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,751
那麼傷口是復元得好快
My wound then healed real quick. 

120
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,383
與及我身體入面那些所謂無名瘡腫And the nameless swellings in my body 

121
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
亦都散走了
were all gone. 

122
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,682
是呀 那麼這個更加給了我信心
Yes, this gave me confidence

123
00:06:45,682 --> 00:06:48,575
去知道這個是良好反應
that tis a good reaction. 

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
那麼自己如何克服初期
How did I overcome the initial 

125
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
那個天水的質素呢
quality of the heavenly fluid? 

126
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:59,071
話說它的氣味色素都好差
Both its odor and color were very poor. 

127
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
因為我查過
I've found that 

128
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
天水的氣味差呢
when your urine smells awful,

129
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
就是身體的內臟開始變差
it means your viscera're worsening. 

130
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
但我亦查到一件事
But I've also found that 

131
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:19,807
就是你身體那自我療癒系統
your self-healing system

132
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
或者是你的免疫系統 是不斷在運作
or your immunity system is constantly working.  

133
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,493
只是問題在於 它是十個茶壺九個蓋
The question is whether its efficiency 

134
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:29,535
七個蓋、五個蓋那樣子
is 90% or 70% or 50%. 

135
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
它還是一直在工作啊
Anyway, tis always working. 

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,727
那麼你身體自己 它用回自己基本有的東西
Even if you feed your body 

137
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,159
你每日給它的垃圾也好 不健康的東西也好With garbage, it can still regulate 

138
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:46,268
他還是可以去調節回你的身體那個情況
your health with its basics. 

139
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:50,498
只是問題在於 你食藥
The problem is that when you take medication,

140
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:51,976
它不會追蹤你的病況
it won't track your illness's state

141
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:55,647
像飛彈般瞄準你的病灶的嘛And aim at your lesion like a missile.  

142
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
藥物只能集中某一方面
Medication can only focus on one aspect

143
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
例如提供功能 讓你不要發炎呀
like stopping your inflammation, 

144
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
或者改變你某些狀況
or changing certain conditions of yours,

145
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,935
是這樣而已
nothing more. 

146
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,263
所以論覆蓋面呢
Urine covers  

147
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,335
天水的覆蓋面是大好多
much more, 

148
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
他因為它是在你身體出來的
for it comes from your body. 

149
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:23,295
他是剛剛幫你調整完你的身體療癒
It helps to adjust and heal your body,

150
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,183
那個修復了的新陳代謝之後的
restoring your metabolism. 

151
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
即所謂你的血清素
Your serum, 

152
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
經過你的心、腎臟Through your kidneys, 

153
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
再滴漏到你的膀胱
dribbles to your bladder. 

154
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,549
即是說 在你膀胱入面那些東西
i.e. what's in your bladder 

155
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,239
完完全全是你身體的情況
represents your body's condition,  

156
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
好多訊息在裏面
with lot of messages inside.  

157
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
我自己會去想
I wonder 

158
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,919
雖然很難說 到底為甚麼會有一個科學的根據
how scientifically 

159
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
是醫好你啦
it cures you. 

160
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:57,599
可能用一個「順勢療法」的思維
We may adopt a homeopathic way of thinking. 

161
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,121
那就是你飲用當刻
When you drink your urine 

162
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,719
你自己身體分泌出來的訊息
as information secreted by your body,

163
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,973
因為你自己身體的信息裏面 帶有一些不好的訊息
the latter may carry certain bad messages, 

164
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:10,436
通常也是你自己不好的身體狀況啦
usu. about your poor bodily condition, 

165
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,703
或者是一些病痛那樣子
or your ailments. 

166
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
然後你飲回帶有這些訊息的東西
When you drink back these messages,  

167
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,559
就他重啓回去
it will reboot 

168
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,922
讓你好似順勢療法那樣 你是讓自己身體And rearm your body with an adaptive power

169
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:25,034
得回一個適應能力啦
just like homeopathy;

170
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:29,599
或者是去推動力的身體去對抗那個病患
or it'll drive your body to fight the disease

171
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,064
或者去調節你的身體
or it'll adjust your body

172
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:34,975
回到一個平衡的狀態那樣And return it to a balanced state. 

173
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,434
所以就是說 飲用的時候呢
In urine drinking, 

174
00:09:38,434 --> 00:09:42,840
也是飲用自己的天水啦
we usu. drink our own urine.  

175
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,703
那當然啦 我猜好多人都…
Of course, I guess many people find it 

176
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,182
你自己都未接受到 更加接受不到飲別人的啦
hard to accept one's own urine, let alone others'. 

177
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:51,325
其實就不是飲別人的天水 
Should we drink the urine  

178
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,395
即不是去飲一些所謂別人屙出來那些
discharged by someone else

179
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,783
質素更好啊 是否應該飲別人那些呢 不是的
if its quality is better? 

180
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,111
其實應該是 愈衝破到自己的心理障礙
When we can break through the psychological barrier,

181
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,231
與及一是帶有自己身體的訊息呢
we should drink only our own urine

182
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,700
更加應該只飲自己的天水
as it contains our body's messages.  

183
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,399
是否這樣去解釋
Don't you think so? 

184
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,700
我開首都說過
I've already said

185
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,263
一百個人飲用天水 有一百個人的方式
different people drink urine in different ways. 

186
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,615
那你說可不可以飲用其他人的天水呢
Can we drink others' urine? 

187
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,425
是可以的
Yes. 

188
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:29,759
只不過你在甚麼條件下去飲呢
But under what conditions? 

189
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
那麼我在這裏又講不到太多
I can't talk too much here. 

190
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,463
若以中醫來計 他就用了童子尿做藥引啦
Children's urine is used as a conductor in Chinese medicine.

191
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,400
童子尿就有它的一些很…
For children's urine

192
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,447
因為小朋友 他有許多好東西在天水裏
is very rich

193
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
是好豐富的嘛
in a lot of good substances. 

194
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
那麼
About this respect,

195
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,000
這方面我暫時不想講太多
I don't wanna talk too much.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,407
是可以飲用其他人的天水
Yes, you may drink others' urine. 

197
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
甚至兩夫妻
To solve a certain problem, 

198
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,319
因為某個問題 你亦都可以飲用對方的天水
husband and wife may exchange urine to drink, 

199
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,671
而大家去做一個修正差別
thereby rectifying the differnce

200
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,279
而去達到某個目的 這裏我不多談了
to achieve a certain purpose. 

201
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
好啦 然後說你身體
OK, 

202
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
那些在你膀胱滴漏下來之後
primarily you have to drink

203
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,799
你首先是要飲用回自己的天水
your own urine dribbled from your bladder. 

204
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,151
那你如何將那個天水去飲用呢
How do you drink it? 

205
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,991
那麼這個經歷 就要看你自己的經歷
That depends on your own experience. 

206
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,831
我的經歷也只屬於我自己的 我是如此這般
My experience belongs to me only. 

207
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,150
我也是像是在街邊行過一間涼茶舖
Initially, tis as if I walked past a herbal tea shop

208
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,625
叫一杯苦茶And ordered a bowl of bitter herbal tea; 

209
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,559
捏住鼻子飲了下去就算了 初初我也是這樣而已
I just pinched my nose and gulped it. 

210
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
然後我曬開太陽 做很多事情配合
Then I sunbathe and do many complementary things.  

211
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
但當你飲到有三、四個月之後
After drinking it for 3-4 months,

212
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
你也做洗腸呀、油拔呀And doing colonic irrigation, 

213
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
背後有好多功法啦
oil pulling, 

214
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
譬如綁腳
having your feet bound

215
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,175
綁着雙腳睡覺那些事情
during sleep, etc. 

216
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:09,599
是可以將原先一杯像咖啡般黑的天水
your initially coffee-black urine

217
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:15,743
變成好似一杯香片茶般清澈的天水
will become as clear as Jasmine-tea,

218
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
即是黑茶變白茶
i.e. from black tea to white tea. 

219
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,935
這就是你的身體那個訊息的修正
This indicates rectification of your bodily message. 

220
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
所以說
Then, 

221
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
是否一定要選擇這個方式呢
is it a must to choose this way? 

222
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,425
嗱! 其實我並我不是甚麼大師、醫師
Look, I'm no master nor doctor.

223
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:36,991
但對於自然療法
But just compare natural therapy

224
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
與及現今坊間的方式
with the mainstream therapies, 

225
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
那麼你是打針食藥
like injection and medication, 

226
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,231
看醫生、施手術
consulting Western doctors and operation, 

227
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
去住一間豪華的醫院
staying in a luxury hospital, 

228
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
然後就
after which

229
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
臨到大去之時 也是在醫院
one passes away in a hospital.  

230
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
這是現今很普遍的情況
This's very common nowadays.  

231
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,263
那麼如果你採用自然療法
What if you adopt natural therapy, 

232
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
即是說 我現在這樣子
like me now? 

233
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
我就不會去醫院看病了
I won't go to the hospital for treatment. 

234
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,127
我會用回坊間一些好簡單的自然療法
I'll use simple natural therapies

235
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,039
就可以了
instead.

236
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,623
當然了 包括你要轉變你的生活方式
Of course, you gotta change your lifestyle, 

237
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
與及你要飲果菜露呀
drink smoothies, 

238
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,544
你要洗腸呀 你要油拔呀
do colonic irrigation and oil pulling,  

239
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:22,256
你要如何去將你的腰骨拉直回去
pull your backbone straight again, 

240
00:13:22,256 --> 00:13:25,049
是很多事宜疊加起來
etc. and etc. 

241
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:27,973
加上你平時都要去一些好的環境And you gotta frequent good surroundings. 

242
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,775
生活質素、空氣質素都要配合
Good living and air qualities are also needed.   

243
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
一個整全式的醫療
A holistic treatment. 

244
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,925
這個是自然療法的一個目標來的
That's an aim of natural therapy's. 

245
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:41,247
如果你繼續是
You may continue 

246
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
我是要做化療呀 我不選擇這些的
to do chemotherapy and 

247
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
我繼續這些
things like that. 

248
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,726
每一個人有每個人的選擇 
Everybody makes independent choices. 

249
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:51,171
所以說一百個人飲天水 有一百個人的方式
Everyone drinks urine in different ways. 

250
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:55,267
至於你如何去克服障礙
As for how you may overcome the obstacles. 

251
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,230
哇! 天水入面好多…
Oh! In urine there's a lot of...

252
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,799
因為我自己飲過天水
I myself have drunk urine, 

253
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,775
我看到入面有好多一條條  的蟲And seen a lot of worms therein,

254
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:13,350
即是好像會有一些白色的東西在裏面
some white things inside. 

255
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,748
甚至乎當我教我太太去用天水 
When I first taught my wife to drink urine, 

256
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:21,951
因為他那個婦女病呢
her gynecological illness 

257
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:26,047
他的情況比我還要差一點
was even worse than my condition. 

258
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
我後來就心想
So I thought about

259
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,471
如何去改善它呢 但我又要去飲
how to improve it. 

260
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
我突然間又遇到一件東西
Suddenly I came across a thing. 

261
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,847
就是有一次呢
One day,

262
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
我太太說要煮飯
my wife said she wanted to cook, 

263
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,039
「啊! 我找不到個茶包袋喎」
but "Oh! I can't find a tea bag."

264
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,623
「我要將花椒八角放進去炆食物喎」
"Wanna put in pepper and anise for braising the food."

265
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
我就「叮一聲」想到啦
That really rang the bell. 

266
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,047
那我就將我的天水做一個隔濾
I then made a filter for my urine. 

267
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
我拿一個茶包袋 將它做為一個隔濾器
I used a tea bag as a filter,

268
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
雖然可能會流失了許多東西
tho' a lot of substances might be lost. 

269
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,375
那我又是量度它的酸鹼度
I measured its alkalinity, 

270
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,031
然後做一個隔濾
and filtered it. 

271
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
然後呢 你要注意其溫度
Then you gotta take note of its temperature. 

272
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:18,015
在外國生活 就可以改為用咖啡濾紙了啊 是嗎
When you live abroad, could you use coffee filter paper instead?

273
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,043
你就看你身邊有甚麼
It depends on what you got at hand. 

274
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,382
我也是身邊找到甚麼 就用甚麼
I use whatever's next to me. 

275
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:27,743
最近我就買了一個純棉的袋
Recently, I bought a 100% cotton bag. 

276
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
那麼每一次我也是做完之後
Each time after doing urinotherapy,  

277
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
我又用牙刷刷乾淨它 然後曬乾
I brush it clean with a toothbrush n dry it in the sun. 

278
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
然後下次再用這樣子
Then I reuse it next time. 

279
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
其實就看你身邊有甚麼可用
Depends on what you got at hand. 

280
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
然後呢
And then

281
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
與及你飲的時候呢
when you drink it,

282
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
基本上有三個條件要考慮啦 第一個就是溫度
You gotta consider 3 conditions, i.e. temperature,

283
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
第二是時間 與及第三 空氣囉
time and air. 

284
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
即是說
i.e.

285
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
有溫度的天水
Heavenly fluid with a warm temperature

286
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
即是有一定的狀態
has a reasonable state. 

287
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,200
即還要一些新鮮的 還保持有體溫的天水是嗎
That's fresh urine with bodily warmth? 

288
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,073
嗯 所以我在英國 因為天氣好冷
Yes, when I was in England, which was cold, 

289
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:09,215
我就會用一個兜裝住熱水 就放我的銅杯進去
I put my copper cup in a bowl of warm water

290
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,031
保持住它的溫度
to hold its temperature.

291
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,336
即是儘管不是馬上飲
Even tho you ain't gonna drink it straight, 

292
00:16:13,336 --> 00:16:16,526
你都要保持住它的溫度才去飲
You gotta keep it warm. 

293
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:21,296
即是不可以太過凍 是嗎 香港這個天氣就不會那麼差
It shouldn't too cold. HK's room temp. 

294
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:23,850
室溫沒那麼差
is not so low. 

295
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,111
至於計算空氣、時間
As for air and time, 

296
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,054
你慢慢掌握囉 是嗎
You gotta grasp them slowly, right? 

297
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,231
並不是說越快越好的
The sooner isn't the better. 

298
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,095
而是你自己要接受它
You gotta accept it. 

299
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,935
你望住它才飲
Look at it while drinking it. 

300
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
不要閉上眼飲
Don't shut your eyes. 

301
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,993
始終它是在幫你的
It is helping you, after all. 

302
00:16:47,993 --> 00:16:50,025
雖然它很乞你憎
Though it may repel you--

303
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,247
「好難聞喎、好大味喎」
"Oh, it stinks! It smells awful!" 

304
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
但它是在幫你
But tis helping you. 

305
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
看你如何克服這個關口
How're you gonna overcome this barrier? 

306
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,864
其實放久了 經過空氣氧化
Indeed, it got odorous 

307
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:04,511
才愈來愈大陣味的
only after long-time oxidation. 

308
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,775
其實 譬如去洗手間
E.g. when we go to the toilet, 

309
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,631
大家可能覺得氣味很餲
we may smell a putrid odor. 

310
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,959
其實當你排出新鮮的天水來
But freshly discharged urine

311
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
我自己的天水無甚麼餲味
has almost no odor. 

312
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,375
但當你們去完廁所 忘記沖廁呢 放久了
But when we forget to flush the toilet

313
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,450
會發覺它愈來愈餲
we'll find it more and more putrid. 

314
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:23,307
不 那個餲味是因為人食了肉、食雜
No, that odor comes from the ammonia 

315
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,991
而釋放的阿蒙尼亞味
released by eaten meat. 

316
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
但時間耐了 氣味都會濃了
But as time goes by, the odor'll grow stronger. 

317
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,775
我發覺是好像愈新鮮 愈沒那種餲味
The fresher, the more odorless, I've found.  

318
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:36,255
我有用老齡的尿 即是放久了的尿
I also use age-old urine 

319
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,815
即是超過三個月 或者半年的
i.e. more than 3 months/6 month old. 

320
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
哦 即是你會儲起它的 對 我會儲起它
So you'll store it? Yes, I'll. 

321
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
我有好多個杯
I have many cups. 

322
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,074
其實你會發現
You'll find that 

323
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:53,407
某一次的天水的狀態非常之好的話呢
when the state of a certain round's urine is very good, 

324
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
他是沒甚麼氣味的
it is odorless. 

325
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
即是所謂食得清 夠健康 對
Which means a healthy diet? Yes. 

326
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,391
那個呢 初期我都有標籤日期在杯上
Initially, I put a date label on each cup. 

327
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,975
那個就是我洗完腸之後
That one's after colonic irrigation, 

328
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:11,071
再加上我是「斷食」完了
and fasting is done

329
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,935
是 即是我還「食生」啦 然後「斷食」啦
plus a raw food diet. 

330
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
然後就保存住那一次的天水呢
The state of that time's urine

331
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,079
那狀態最好的 即是身體已完全排毒了
was the best. The body's wholly detoxified. 

332
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,895
你直是不知道它有氣味的
You simply can't smell anything. 

333
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
即淡到這個程度啦
Its odor is as light as that. 

334
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,759
即是你擺在窗台上 一定有氣味
When placed on the windowsill, urine'll emit odor.  

335
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
但你逐杯去聞聞它們
But when you smell them cup by cup, 

336
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
跟它們聊聊天 有一些是無甚氣味的And talk to them, you'll find some of them odorless. 

337
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
所以我每一次我用天水呢
So each time I use heavenly fluid,

338
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
點指兵兵那時呢 我也是要先問問它
I'll consult them, 

339
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,887
哪些氣味大的呢 我就先用它And choose the more odorous ones. 

340
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
聽起來都好有畫面感呀
Very vivid. 

341
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,113
然後就再將它加熱
Then I warm it up, 

342
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:55,550
然後再去溝開 然後拿來洗腸
dilute it and irrigate my colon with it. 

343
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,300
即是去到很講究 洗腸都有用它 是呀
So you even use it for colonic irrigation? 

344
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,551
這些後面再講吧
Will talk about this later. 

345
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:04,068
談回你的問題 就是說你的身體不好
Back to your qt. When your health's poor,

346
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:12,255
更加需要去補充回你身體需要那個訊息
You need to replenish the message your body needs. 

347
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
你可以從滴兩滴
You may start with 1 or 2 droplets 

348
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
從你的舌底開始
under your tongue.

349
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,679
你的身體已經會知悉
Your body'll already be aware. 

350
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
是呀
Yes

351
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,727
滴兩滴都夠的了
1 or 2 drops is enough. 

352
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,311
取了信息先 與及飲的份量呢
Get the message 1st. Regarding the amount, 

353
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,383
並非飲得愈多愈好的啊
"The more you drink, the better" isn't true. 

354
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
因為你飲得多呢
For when you drink much,

355
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
你的身體的負荷就大了
your body'll be overloaded,

356
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,551
那麼你個人就變得好疲累And you'll become very tired

357
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,367
好想睡覺
and sleepy. 

358
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
所以呢
So 

359
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
你是飲一個茶杯的份量
just drink a teacup of it,  

360
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:45,025
約莫是 180ml 左右
around 180 ml 

361
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:47,327
180毫升 是的
yes, 180 millimeter. 

362
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,655
那麼 你飲如此的份量
You drink this dose.    

363
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,853
已不少的啊
Tis already something,

364
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:56,554
已經是我們那些 375 毫升盒裝飲品的一半
already half of a 373 ml juicebox. 

365
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:58,675
是啦 差唔多啦 如果講份量
Yes, more or less.

366
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:04,223
就像茶餐廳那種杯的半杯茶左右
Around half a HK café teacup. 

367
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
我現在飲得少一點
Now I drink less than before. 

368
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
我是用一個茶杯這樣 約莫140ml左右吧
1 teacup each time, around 140 ml. 

369
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
但我每天是不止飲一次的
But I drink more than once everyday. 

370
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
早晚 還是早午晚這樣?
Twice daily, or thrice daily? 

371
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
其實只要隨你喜歡就可以
As you like it. 

372
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
何解呢 因為份量越少
Why? 'cause the lesser the amount, 

373
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,887
你身體的負荷沒那麼大
the lesser the load on your body. 

374
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
因為有一個原理 叫做「以毒攻毒」
This's called "combating one toxin with another toxin". 

375
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:32,895
那你飲了落去 你個身體要馬上作戰
Right after drinking it, your body gotta do battle.

376
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,364
將那個你自己的療癒系統
For your healing system 

377
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:37,503
自我修復系統激發了嘛
or self-restoration system is triggered. 

378
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,251
是嗎 他真的吸收了你的訊息
It really absorbs your message

379
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,879
然後它又分泌一些訊息
and then secretes some other message

380
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,725
供其它的器官做一些內分泌
for other organs as endocrine, 

381
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:52,750
即是你的尿呀、關節液呀
i.e. your urine, joint fluid,
 
382
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,290
涕、唾、油、淚、脂
snot, saliva, oil, tears, fat, 

383
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,447
汗、血、膿、痰、膽汁
Sweat, blood, pus, phlegm, bile,

384
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
以至你的小腦
to your cerebellum. 

385
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,847
這是你的上水道的一般器官那個訊息場
These comprise the info. field of your upper waterway organs.

386
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:10,015
那你就不怕分開多幾次飲用
You may divide it into a few times more. 

387
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,575
反而你會輕鬆好多
Then you'll be much easier. 

388
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
是否你飲得多就好呢
The more you drink, the better? 

389
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
等於食藥也是早晚一次啦
You usu. take medication only twice daily

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
或者一日三次啦
or thrice daily. 

391
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,328
其實是讓你的負荷減輕而已
Tis to lessen your load. 

392
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,960
「不是喎 食兩粒藥
"No, I wish to recover sooner, 

393
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,487
我吃夠四粒啦 我想快點好喎…」
why not 4 pills instead of 2?" 

394
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,496
那麼你的身體就累了啦
Then your body'll become tired. 

395
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,520
OK! OK!
OK! OK! 

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,336
其實就類似這樣了
Something like that. 

397
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,448
你這是過來人的經驗啦 
You're speaking from personal experience. 

398
00:21:38,448 --> 00:21:41,644
大家可以視乎你們自己的身體狀況
It depends on your own bodily condition

399
00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:44,064
或者你的接受能力
or your receptivity. 

400
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,880
或者這樣說 如果最少
For beginners like us

401
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,488
以我們剛剛初學這樣 初階樣子
at the elementary stage, 

402
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,304
我每日最少飲幾多次
how many times must I drink it daily,

403
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,900
飲幾多量 可以達致一定有效果呢And how much each time, to get the effect? 

404
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,402
是否即是起碼都最少一次
At least once daily? 

405
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,544
他處於甚麼狀態先?
Depends on their bodily state. 

406
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,930
就說身體有少許毛病先啦
Let's say the body got some illness.  

407
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,128
說真的 你身體沒毛病
Frankly, people'd not dare to try it, 

408
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,875
大家也未必會英勇於嘗試呢件事
if their health's ok. 

409
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,275
嗱 我不是診症呀
Look, I'm not diagnosing.

410
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:15,857
我這樣問你身體有甚麼毛病
When I ask what's wrong with your body,

411
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,710
只為代入我以前在哪個階段的做法而已
I'm trying to match it against my stage. 

412
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,501
你那個階段都頗為惡劣了
That stage of yours was rather bad:- 

413
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:25,000
因為去到糖尿二期、爛腳這樣子
Diabetes stage II plus athlete's foot. 

414
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:27,328
其實我覺得都頗嚴重了
I deem it rather serious. 

415
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
是呀 在那個階段
Yes, at that stage, 

416
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,472
我是一日飲兩次
I drank twice daily, 

417
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,824
那時我飲的份量較多
and the amount each time was larger. 

418
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,128
所以我就整日都想睡覺 好攰
So I was sleepy and fatigued all day long. 

419
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
OK
OK 

420
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,198
因為我心急醫病嘛
For I was eager to heal myself. 

421
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:48,320
但到後來發現 其實不是這樣的
Later I found it doesn't work that way. 

422
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
那麼你若像我現在這樣呢
Now

423
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,928
我是每日都飲
I drink it daily,  

424
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,952
每日都飲
every day, 

425
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:55,744
一次至兩次
once or twice, 

426
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
每一次都是一個茶杯份量
1 teacup each time.  

427
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,982
即是剛才你說的140至180毫升之間
i.e. 140-180 ml as aforesaid by you. 

428
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:04,192
那麼你個人就會好舒服
Then you'll feel easy. 

429
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,825
是呀 你不會突然之間很攰呀這樣子
Yes. You won't suddenly feel very tired. 

430
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:11,104
如果你在斷食的時候呢
When you're fasting, 

431
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,408
好奇妙的喎
curiously, 

432
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,313
你是不需要進食的啊
You don't have to eat. 

433
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,775
你飲了它之後
After drinking it, 

434
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:19,516
你不會說「啊! 我肚餓呀!」
You won't say, "Oh, I'm hungry!" 

435
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:21,856
失去了這種飢餓感
You'll lose the feeling of hunger. 

436
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,309
然後你去做做園藝
Then you do gardening. 

437
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,750
那一日你就不用進食的了
And you don't have to eat that day. 

438
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,231
你沒有飢餓感
You won't feel hungry. 

439
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:29,536
除非你在斷食之前
Unless, before fasting, 

440
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
食得很飽
You have eaten a lot. 

441
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:36,960
那麼斷食那一日 你就會很辛苦了
Then on the day of fasting, you'll have a hard time. 

442
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,032
我在網上看
I've found online that

443
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
有個西班牙女子
there's a Spanish girl

444
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,968
她是用天水斷食31日
who fasted for 31 days with heavenly fluid. 

445
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,425
她也是說「我喜歡飲就飲 隨我鍾意」
"I drink it whenever I want to," she also said. 

446
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:58,976
即是她也是邊飲天水 邊做斷食 她做31天
i.e. she fasted for 31 days while drinking urine. 

447
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:03,328
所以其實你問的那問題
Just now, you asked me 

448
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:06,144
就是如果好似現在我同你這個狀態這樣
what to do

449
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,448
如果你現在這個狀態
in a state like yours and mine now.

450
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
就等如我那個時候
In those days, 

451
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,568
我也是一日飲…
Everyday I also drank...

452
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,384
斷食的時候 我一日會飲三至四次
When fasting, I drank it 3 to 4 times daily. 

453
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,688
我會袋住一個杯出街的
I'd carry a cup with me when I went out. 

454
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:21,760
但如果我平時呢
In normal times, 

455
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,296
我就一日飲兩次
I'd drink twice daily. 

456
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:27,136
有時我也是一日飲一次
Sometimes, I drank once daily. 

457
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,768
就看自己在甚麼狀態
Depends on my state. 

458
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
那現在你太太也是跟你一樣
Now does your wife also drink urine

459
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:40,192
也是同樣每日最少飲一次是嗎
at least once daily like you?

460
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:43,776
另外再加上 好似用爽膚水那樣啦
In addition, she applies it as toner
 
461
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
搽頭髮那樣呀
to her hair. 

462
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
我見你真的是…
I think you're really...

463
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,152
不 有些人呢
No, some people

464
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,968
就一定會敷在心臟處
apply it to their heart.

465
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,808
為甚麼是敷在心臟位置呢
Why the heart? 

466
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,856
因為你敷在心那個位置呢
For your heart is then

467
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:02,720
你的心臟去吸收那天水是最接近的
closest to the heavenly fluid. 

468
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,280
即是你不用口服
Then you don't have to take it orally. 

469
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,584
直接搽落心臟
Simply apply it to your heart 

470
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
讓它直接去吸收
for it to absorb directly. 

471
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
因皮膚吸收
Whatever's absorbed by your skin,

472
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,008
是替你直接入血的嘛
goes straight into your blood.

473
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,080
那個距離是最近的嘛
The distance is the closest. 

474
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,408
我還見到有些人
I've also seen someone 

475
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
他是拿一塊繃紗帶
stick a piece of bandage 

476
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
固定在他的背脊位置
to their backbone,

477
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,808
即好像跌打敷藥般
just like applying Chinese bone balm,

478
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,344
哦 是
Oh, yes. 

479
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,416
然後他還用保鮮紙包住它
He then wrapped it in plastic wrap, 

480
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,816
讓天水最直接進入那個部位
so that the urine'd go straight into the area. 

481
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,168
這裏是有着不同的方式
There're different ways to do it. 

482
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
這個明白的
I see. 

483
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,471
大家如果有甚麼是要注意的
What else people have to pay heed to? 

484
00:25:48,471 --> 00:25:50,471
就是有沒有所謂的…
Is there any...

485
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,500
不光是說你自己親身做
Based on not only your own experience 

486
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,200
其實你之前從網上、從書本
but on what you've learnt from books 

487
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
你都看過好多嘛
and from the net,

488
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,779
你看過的這些資料
have you come across any information

489
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:02,880
其實有沒有說某些人
about what kind of people 

490
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,672
或者甚麼狀態下的人
or what kind of state of people 

491
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,024
是不適合天水療法的呢
is not suitable for urinotherapy? 

492
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,250
又或者有沒有哪些症狀是特別有效? 
Or is it esp. good for any symptoms? 

493
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,424
起碼即是你自己這個糖尿二期
At least for your diabetes stage II

494
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216
是特別有效啦
it's particularly effective. 

495
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:21,104
你有個朋友就直接拿來搽身喇
A friend of yours applied it to his body straight

496
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:26,432
將自己那個濕疹 直是換了皮膚般樣子啦
and replaced her eczema with smooth skin. 

497
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
對啦 除了這個糖尿病和濕疹之外
Apart from diabetes and eczema, 

498
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,457
那是至少你有自己的親身經驗
which based on your experience,

499
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:34,112
與朋友的經驗特別好之外
and your friend's experience, uropathy serves well,

500
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,952
有沒有甚麼情況 是特別適合 或特別不適合使用天水
are there any conditions esp. suitable 

501
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,512
可以提一提點大家的呢
or esp. unsuitable for uropathy?

502
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
你用天水
Is heavenly fluid 

503
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,123
是否一定是飲用為最好呢
best for drinking?

504
00:26:44,123 --> 00:26:47,680
其實要看你自己感到舒服
It depends on whether you feel comfortable. 

505
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:52,032
那麼你如果連外敷都接受不了
If you can't even accept external application,

506
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:58,688
那麼你就無謂去飲啦 免得你不舒服
then don't drink it,

507
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,225
令那個「好轉反應」更大
lest that the healing crisis is too much. 

508
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:06,368
其實我們當初都說過
We've mentioned 

509
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,416
當初為甚麼會接觸尿療法
why I approached urinotherapy in the 1st place. 

510
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,280
為甚麼你會搞這套 也是看到一些紀錄片在談論它
Tis 'cause I saw some documentaries on it. 

511
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,608
其實都是對上一些有病痛的人
Usu. only people with ailments  

512
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:21,216
他們會去嘗試 或者真的無辦法了
would try it; they can't but

513
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
他都要衝破這個心理關口
break through the psychological barrier

514
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,080
他也要「不妨試一試啦」這樣子
and "give it a try". 

515
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,688
是呀 我的朋友 我通常不跟他說
Yes. I usu. don't tell my friends
516
  
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,016
我有飲用天水呀 我都只是囑咐朋友
I'm drinking urine. I just advise them

517
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,622
「你做做油拔吧」「洗洗腸吧」
to do oil pulling, colonic irrigation, 

518
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:40,700
「拌些果菜露飲吧」這樣
and to drink smoothie.

519
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,254
如果他連這些事情都不做
If they won't even do these, 

520
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:45,024
那麼我跟他講再多的都沒用 是嗎
tis useless to tell them more, right? 

521
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,400
這些都不去嘗試
When they wouldn't even try these, 

522
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,679
很難一下子就用天水那麼極端
tis hard for them to go as far as uropathy. 

523
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,199
有些朋友 他連飲「水克菲爾」都接受不了的
Some friends can't even accept kefir, 

524
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:57,415
那你就無謂跟他談天水方面的事情啦
why tell them about heavenly fluid? 

525
00:27:57,415 --> 00:28:02,944
這是他個人的抉擇囉
That's their personal choice. 

526
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
那麼我相信…
Then I believe...

527
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,207
甚麼人不適宜飲天水呢
What kind of people isn't suitable for uropathy?

528
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:13,184
如果你接受不了 你就無需要飲了
If you can't accept it, then don't drink it. 

529
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:15,744
若以我自己作計算
In my case, 

530
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,792
我太太也是
my wife initially 

531
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,866
一開始都沒有陪我一齊飲
did not drink it with me either. 

532
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:23,168
但我做這件事 我是有跟她分享的
But I did tell her about my practice. 

533
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,500
原因是我看了很多英文平台的資訊
I've read a lot of info. on English platforms. 

534
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,525
因為英文程度不太好
As my English is no good, 

535
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:33,525
有好多資料 是我太太替我翻譯的
my wife's translated a lot of info. for me.

536
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,641
看完之後…雖然Google有translate功能 
Though there's google-translate,

537
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:39,808
但有些語法譯出來不暢順
the translation is often not so fluent. 

538
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,880
Penny 替我看過後
After going through it for me, and Penny 

539
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
還是未開始用天水的啊
still didn't start drinking urine. 

540
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,000
是我開始先的
I started first. 

541
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,825
而我開始了差不多一年多
Tis not until I'd done it for over 1 yr.,

542
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:54,656
她才開始的啊
that she started. 

543
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,704
最初她同樣是接受不了的
Initially she couldn't accept it either. 

544
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,776
嗯 反而這方面你可問問她啦
You may ask her about this. 

545
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,229
為甚麼她會開始呢
Why did she ever begin?

546
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:03,229
這亦是因為她身體有問題
Tis also because she's ill. 

547
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,146
那麼如果你除了聽完這一集節目之外
Apart from this episode, 

548
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,808
可能有些人仍然希望挖掘多點天水資料
pls recommend more sources on uropathy,

549
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,962
那麼有沒有一些的書籍 或者你聽過的 
be it books or what you've heard,

550
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:22,048
可以介紹給大家的呢 無論中英文都可以
both Eng. and Chin. will do. 

551
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,420
譬如我知道中文方面
E.g. concerning Chin. sources,

552
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,448
就有一本叫做《尿療法治百病》的書
there's a book entitled Urinotherapy Cures Every Disease;

553
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:32,032
有一本就叫《回龍湯》啦
Another one is The Returning Dragon's Soup. 

554
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,646
談去這裏 我就找來 Victor 和 Penny
We're honored to have Victor and Penny.  

555
00:29:36,646 --> 00:29:40,550
她就看了一些外國書籍
She's read some foreign books

556
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,558
再吸收了多些關於天水療法的知識
on urinotherapy. 

557
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,558
那其實有沒有一些書籍
Would you pls recommend some books

558
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,875
介紹給大家
to our audience? 

559
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,512
如果可以的話 我就放一些連結在這裏 
If possible, I'll put some links here 

560
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:55,229
讓大家有興趣可以找到一些相關的中英文書籍
to related English and Chinese books

561
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,725
去再學多一些
for your reference.

562
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:58,117
看那些英文書籍
Would you pls recommend 

563
00:29:58,117 --> 00:30:01,212
其實有沒有哪一兩本特別出名的著作
one or two well known Eng. books

564
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:03,212
給大家試讀
on urinotherapy? 

565
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,675
有一本書叫做 "The water of life"
There's a book called The Water of Life. 

566
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:10,176
另外一些你就要搜尋關於 "Aging Urine" 的
You may search for Aging Urine as well. 

567
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,784
因為他們說那些「舊天水」是很好的
They say "aging urine" is very good. 

568
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,724
那我要的真找找這兩本書的連結
I will find the links to these 2 books,

569
00:30:17,724 --> 00:30:21,440
我就放在今集下邊位置啦
and put them below this episode

570
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,902
大家可以去看看
for your reference. 

571
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:26,644
用這些字眼去搜尋 找着找着
Search for these key words

572
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:30,275
應該找到很多相關的資料 是啊And you'll find a lot of related info. Yes. 

573
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:36,800
通常大部分的書籍 網上資料都在說
Most books and online materials advise you 

574
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,176
飲用朝早起身第一篤天水啦
to drink the 1st round of urine every morning. 

575
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,248
關於飲用的時間與及
As for the drinking schedule, 

576
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:50,014
飲用的杯子的物料 有沒有甚麼講究
and the material of the cup, 

577
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,416
你可以跟大家分享一下嗎
do you have any specifications? 

578
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,720
我看過一個影片
I have seen a video 

579
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,048
是台灣一對夫婦劉先生
about a Taiwanese Mr. Lau and his wife

580
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,376
他在影片中就有講述到
In that video he mentions 

581
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,984
他不用玻璃杯飲天水
that he doesn't drink urine with a glass 

582
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
他說原因是
He says tis because

583
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,644
他就是說現今的玻璃已經纖維化了
Today's glass is in fact fibreglass, 

584
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:13,644
加了很多纖維進去
reinforced with a lot of fibre. 

585
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,875
杯子做得很快 做得很薄
This kind of quickly made glasses is very thin; 

586
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:22,050
於是乎 因為天水中有阿蒙尼亞那些東西
as urine contains Ammonia, 

587
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,696
於是你的天水的質素
the quality of your urine

588
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,304
就會打折扣
will be compromised. 

589
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:39,008
有些揮發了 你可能只剩下……
Some of it will volatize...

590
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,080
我又不想說剩下多少
I don't wanna say how much'll be left.

591
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152
所以如果你知道會流失
When you know the loss's preventable,  

592
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,025
可以避免的話 那你就去避免 是嗎
surely you'll try to prevent it, right? 

593
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:51,808
因為如果你上網看 很多人甚至用紅酒杯飲
Many people even drink it with red wine cups.

594
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
但如果你看完這條影片之後呢
But after I watched that video...

595
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,672
其實影片在說
In fact it's talking about...

596
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:01,280
我就找到有一篇文章談到
I've found an article which says

597
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
他是用「金、銀、銅」物料
"Gold, silver and copper" are used as materials. 

598
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
排位?
How about the order of importance? 

599
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,448
金杯、銀杯、銅杯
Gold cup, silver cup, copper cup. 

600
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,008
是的 或者竹造的杯
Yes. Or bamboo cup; 

601
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,568
甚至乎用樹葉都可以的
Even leaf may be used. 

602
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,688
是的 用樹葉 那你剪一張樹葉
Yes, you may cut a leaf

603
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,272
那些芭蕉葉又好 裹糉葉也好
be it banana leaf or lotus leaf

604
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,112
剪成銀紙般大小
Size it down into the size of a banknote

605
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,416
放在銀包裏
Put it in your wallet.  

606
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,756
那麼當你到了要飲的時候
When you need to drink urine, 

607
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:33,024
你就去洗手間 將它捲一捲
go to the washroom, 

608
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,584
就褶成一個杯囉 有這個做法
and fold it into a cup. 

609
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
OK 我這裏跟你說
Look

610
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:43,183
其實杯子沒特別講究一定要哪隻杯才最好
You don't have to be particular about

611
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:45,475
是否一定要某隻杯才可以
what kind of cup to use. 

612
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,875
總之起碼大家可以
But at least 

613
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,481
盡量不用玻璃杯
try not to use a glass cup. 

614
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:56,064
因為現代的玻璃未必好
For modern glass isn't necessarily good.

615
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,672
即是杯子其實不是很講究 即如剛才說
Again, you don't have to be particular about the cup.

616
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,976
甚至用樹葉都可以啦
Even a leaf will do. 

617
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,854
那時間上呢
How about the timing? 

618
00:33:04,854 --> 00:33:10,325
是否飲用朝早第一篤真的最好?
Is the first round of urine in the morning the best? 

619
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:12,960
杯子方面 我是這樣的
Concerning cup, I use

620
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,568
有用銅杯和銀杯 飲下去那個感覺是不同的
both copper and silver cups.

621
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:20,384
你會覺得高貴好多
Will make you feel much more high-class 

622
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,432
高格調好多
or elitist. 

623
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:25,234
我都覺得如此 金杯應該高貴一些
Yes, a gold cup should feel more high-class. 

624
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:28,832
如果四條九足金就更如是啦 當然最好啦
A 9999 gold cup is surely the best. 

625
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,368
至於你問到幾時飲呢
As for the time for drinking, 

626
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,700
其實一般來說是朝早啦 是嗎
tis usu. early in the morning, isn't it? 

627
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,725
我亦都有考究過
I've done some research, 

628
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,800
查過一些影片
and gone through some videos, 

629
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,120
說過在半夜…
which say midnight...

630
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
半夜起床?!
What? Get up at midnight?! 

631
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,984
半夜兩點半至四點半那個時候
Between 2:30 am and 4:30 am. 

632
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,568
那麼各位如果有去屙夜尿的朋友 
Those of you who oft wake up at night to pee

633
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,650
就有福啦
are blessed. 

634
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,944
不是 其實不用刻意起床
No, you don't have to painstakingly 

635
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,480
飲這個天水
get up at nite to drink urine. 

636
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,296
那個講法呢
The argument

637
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,832
就是說
is as follows:

638
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,624
當你一個人
When you 

639
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,440
處於一個休息狀態
are in a resting mode, 

640
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,488
休眠狀態
a dormant mode, 

641
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,304
乃至於睡眠狀態
a slumber state, 

642
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
即是你個人靜止了
i.e. when you are at rest  

643
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,680
你在一個全黑的地方
in a completely dark place,

644
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,472
那麼你的身體
your body will 

645
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,776
就會分泌一個褪黑色素
secret melatonin, 

646
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
即是由你的腎上腺
i.e. your adrenal glands 

647
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,896
分泌一些褪黑色素去保護你
will secrete melatonin to protect you. 

648
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,712
但這個褪黑色素 
But this melatonin secretion

649
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,528
它不會維持整晚 可能維持兩個小時左右
will only last around 2 hours at night.

650
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:35,648
因為當你去到一個睡眠狀態之後
After you reach a certain state of sleep, 

651
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,440
那個褪黑色素就消退了
the melatonin will fade away. 

652
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,048
他說的這個原理就是
The theory is:-

653
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:47,168
古人以前去打獵
When ancient guys went hunting, 

654
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,984
害怕有些老虎叼走你
they were afraid they'd be eaten up by tigers. 

655
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:58,858
所以他就會處於緊張的防備狀態中睡覺
So they slept in a state of alert, 

656
00:34:58,858 --> 00:35:03,040
那麼他的身體就會有這個褪黑色素出來
and their body'd secrete melatonin. 

657
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,344
關於這個黑色素
About this melatonin, 

658
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
我最近聽朋友講
I've heard that 

659
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:12,000
更有用它製成的藥丸出售
there're pills made of it for sale. 

660
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
但我相信你飲回你自己那些天水是最好的
But I think tis best to drink your own urine. 

661
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,264
於是乎在這個基礎下
In this context, 

662
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,592
就有些人講
some people say 

663
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:30,688
飲兩三點鐘的天水最佳
urine discharged between 2 and 3 am is the best,

664
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:34,016
因為含有那種激素
as it contains melatonin. 

665
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,600
但至於你說 要不要調校鬧鐘起來飲
But I don't think you have to 

666
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,904
那我就認為不需要
set an alarm to drink it. 

667
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:44,000
如果你真的要在這個時間飲天水呢
If you really wanna drink urine at this hour, 

668
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,328
那麼你應該早點睡覺
then you should go to bed early,

669
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:50,738
早些睡覺啦 你的身體在一個好狀態
and your body'll be in a good state. 

670
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,650
早睡怎麼樣總是好的
Tis good to sleep early anyway. 

671
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,520
與及不要吃太多碳水化合物
And don't eat too much carbohydrate. 

672
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,075
因為碳水化合物會令你很累
For it'll make you very tired, 

673
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,432
會令你的黑色素分泌時間縮短
and shorten your duration of melatonin secretion. 

674
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
哦 明白
Got it. 

675
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,435
這個是 我只說這是我習慣如此而已
This is just my own habit. 

676
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:14,720
但我現在現在都沒有特意起床
But I do not get up specifically 

677
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
去飲天水呀
to drink heavenly fluid. 

678
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,608
跟住當天的感覺 順其自然
I follow the day's feel. You let nature take its course.  

679
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,978
即是去到兩三點 夢夢鬆鬆
i.e. between 2 and 3 am, in a dreaming state, 

680
00:36:22,978 --> 00:36:24,978
記得就飲 忘記了就算啦 這樣
drink it if you remember, otherwise let it be. 

681
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:27,738
與及他說 你一定要把燈全關掉
And they say you gotta turn off all the lights. 

682
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:31,616
在個漆黑漆的地方睡覺 你的黑色素才會出來
Only when you sleep in a pitch-dark place will your melatonin come out.

683
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
如果你着了燈睡覺
When you sleep with the lights on, 

684
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,760
即是你自己尚未進入那個防備狀態
and you're still in the mode of alert, 

685
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,320
那個黑色素是不會分泌出來的
melatonin won't be secreted. 

686
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
哦 明白
I see. 

687
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,768
好了 兩集的時間就來到這裏了
OK, these 2 episodes are coming to an end. 

688
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:53,610
我猜大家會自己做做功課
I guess you'll do your homework

689
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,424
決定要不要嘗試
and decide whether to try it. 

690
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,264
又或者 到底你會不會
Or, will you try it 

691
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,825
在身體無甚病痛下都去嘗試呢 
even if your health is alright? 

692
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:05,664
還是像 Victor 般屬於比較「異類」的人
Or are you somewhat "extraordinary" like Victor? 

693
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,784
或真的可能身體有些病痛了
Maybe when you're really ill, 

694
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,538
及至真有點兒無法處理的時候
and unable to cope with it, 

695
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:17,440
終於去勇於嘗試
You'll finally have the courage to try it. 

696
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,825
另外有一件頗吸引我的事
There's an anecdote rather intriguing for me. 

697
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:26,575
就是我見到中醫書籍裏有個故事
Acc. to a Chinese herbal medicine book, 

698
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:30,350
一篇古文記載了一位醫師
a doctor in ancient times

699
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,288
他見到一位老婦
came across an old woman. 

700
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,784
應該說他見到一個年約八十歲婦人
She's aged 80, 

701
00:37:35,784 --> 00:37:38,688
但樣子看上去卻只四十歲左右
but she looked like 40. 

702
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:42,775
然後醫師就問這個婦人原因
The doctor asked her how come. 

703
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:45,400
婦人說 她以前身體有病 
She said she had been sick. 

704
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,366
聞說飲這個天水可以醫病
Ever since she heard drinking urine can cure illnesses, 

705
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:54,048
她就是由那個時候飲到現在
she'd been drinking it. 

706
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,375
所以就說這個中醫寫這個故事
The doctor put down this story,

707
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:02,850
記載了有人樣子相當年輕
recording that someone who regularly drank urine

708
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:09,920
而這個人是有長年飲用天水 因而有這個效用
looked rather young. 

709
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,906
雖然沒講到是否直接有關
Tis not stated whether tis causation   

710
00:38:13,906 --> 00:38:15,775
這個無法考究
or correlation. 

711
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:22,544
但幾本中醫書都有說過
But tis mentioned in several Chinese medicine books. 

712
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:25,536
其中談到飲用這個天水
It is said that drinking urine

713
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,656
可能有這個回春 又或者凍齡的效果
may rejuvenate people or keep them young.  

714
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,912
我相信很多女士們
I believe many ladies

715
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:36,544
這方面可能比男士更加勇敢了
are braver than men in this aspect. 

716
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,015
應該你無病無痛的時候
Even if you aren't ill, 

717
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,432
都不妨試下 而跟Victor都談到
You may give it a try. Victor's also talked about

718
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,946
如果你剛好真的有勇氣嘗試的時候
how to break through the psychological barrier

719
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,320
你如何衝破心理關口
if you're courageous enough to try it. 

720
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,392
先不用飲的啦 先來外敷啦
Initially, instead of drinking it, 

721
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,768
你用作外敷 搽皮膚呀 用過搽頭髮呀
You may try external application to skin or hair. 

722
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,091
你見到有效果 有改善
When you see some effect or improvement, 

723
00:38:59,091 --> 00:39:02,100
那你自然就有更大的信心
You'll have more confidence

724
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,728
考慮是否真的去到飲用狀態啦
to consider whether to drink it. 

725
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
其他事情呢 剛才這兩集都講過
As mentioned in these 2 episodes,

726
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:17,248
一百個人心態 有一百個人不同的方法和效果
different people have different ways and effects. 

727
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,648
因為這一門療法 沒有一個尿療法醫師
Regarding this therapy, there's no 

728
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:27,488
或療法的大師呀 沒有這人物存在
great master. 

729
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,543
那就靠大家自己聽完這兩集節目
After seeing these 2 episodes, 

730
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:33,120
再多做功課
You're supposed to do your homework

731
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,472
你自己決定如何嘗試 如何做啦 
and decide how to do it. 

732
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,694
我們訪問Victor
We interview Victor

733
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:42,848
以他作為一個真的用了超過三年以上經驗的人
simply because he has done it for over 3 years

734
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:47,456
去做一個分享而已
and he's willing to share his experience. 

735
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,528
臨尾Victor 是否還有一些東西想分享下
Victor, do you still have something else to share? 

736
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
其實我們飲用天水
Drinking urine 

737
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,672
這是一個大自然的現象
is a natural phenomenon. 

738
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,232
一棵樹
A tree 

739
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
它去到秋天
in Autumn

740
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,584
它要過冬 要落葉
will shed leaves, 

741
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,144
葉是落在它的根部
which will fall on its roots, 

742
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:10,201
它的根部就是吸收回那些樹葉
and its roots will absorb back those leaves, 

743
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:13,568
來準備給自己過冬
for itself to survive Winter. 

744
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,152
而這個所謂回春的方法
This method of rejuvenation 

745
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,432
你也是一樣
is also 

746
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,016
這是個大自然現象
a phenomenon of nature. 

747
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,064
大家如何去用
How to use it? 

748
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:27,392
其實由外敷開始 你見到那個效果最明顯了
Start with ext. application whose effect's apparent. 

749
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,593
「啊! 我心不舒服…」你可以搽心口
When your heart aches, apply urine to it. 

750
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:35,800
我都是這樣 哪裏不舒服 我就敷哪裏
I myself apply it to whichever part feels uneasy. 

751
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,680
你可以保存一些
You may store some heavenly fluid 

752
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
你用一個瓷器保存住一些天水
in a porcelain container 

753
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
你擺放一段時間
for some time. 

754
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,360
你越放得耐
The longer the storing time, 

755
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,992
用那天水來搽皮膚傷患
the more effective it is, 

756
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
效果愈見快速
when tis applied to skin troubles. 

757
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:57,856
你不用理會天水的質素好不好
You don't have to care about its quality. 

758
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:02,464
你沒量度酸鹼度又好 它很大氣味又好
Even if its odor is strong and its alkalinity unchecked,

759
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,560
無論如何 你都拿來搽你的傷口
You may apply it to your wound. 

760
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
例如被蛇咬啊
E.g. when you're bitten by a snake. 

761
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:12,192
怎麼樣都好 這是一些古典書籍都有記載的
This is recorded in ancient books. 

762
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,063
或蚊釘蟲咬等 對
Yes, mosquito-sting or bug-bite. 

763
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:18,080
你可以用一個很細的小花樽裝起來
You may store it in a very small vase.   

764
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,432
但小花樽的樽口偏細 你或可用一隻杯裝起它
But its mouth may be too small. Ok, store it in a cup

765
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:25,137
然後用一條毛巾蓋住它 再用橡皮圈紮住它
Cover it with a cloth and bound it with a rubber band, 

766
00:41:25,137 --> 00:41:27,100
即是好像製水克菲爾那樣
the way Kefir is made,  

767
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,099
讓它進行一個鍊金術效果
and let it go through an alchemical process, 

768
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,464
讓它曬曬太陽 曬曬月光
Expose it to sunshine and moonlight,  

769
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,280
然後你拿來搽
and then apply it to your skin. 

770
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,680
是一個好神奇 好奇妙的治療方式
Tis a very marvelous therapy.

771
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
尤其是燒傷、燙傷
Esp. for burns and scalds, 

772
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
效果非常快
the effect is real quick. 

773
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:48,800
好
Fine. 

774
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,759
好了 真的終於今集要完結了 
Fine, this episode's really gonna end. 

775
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:56,950
希望這兩集幫到有需要的朋友啦 
Hope these 2 episodes are of use to friends in need. 

776
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,831

Listen to the contents first. 

777
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:03,486
不知道這一集到底可以幫到幾多人
Wonder how many people this episode can help, 

778
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:06,430
或者有幾多人真的肯嘗試喇
or how many people are willing to try. 

779
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,767
如果你曾經試過
If you've tried it, 

780
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,095
又或者試過之後有甚麼效果 你不妨到時…
you may contact us in private 

781
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,935

782
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:18,239
跟我們談談它 
be it good or bad. 

783
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,801
好啦 今日今集時間就這麼多了
OK, this episode will end here. 

784
00:42:20,801 --> 00:42:24,127
多謝 Victor 啦
Thank you Victor. 

785
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
多謝大家 多謝大家
Thank you everybody. 

786
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455

Fine. 

787
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,375
拜拜 拜拜
Byebye. Byebye.
